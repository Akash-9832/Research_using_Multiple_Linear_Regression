The focus of this research is to technically analyse the potential bridge sites based on the major prioritization indices and to determine risk factors related to particular locations leading to solutions for the permanent transportation problem in Nepal.
We collected data by mobilizing local NGOs and informing the public through local radio to conduct a comprehensive study of nationwide bridge demand. The secondary source of data for postbridge building assessment is extracted through the project management information system. And we received more than 5800 data.

The model was evaluated using (50-50)%, (66-34)%, and (80-20)% train-test splits and 10-fold cross-validation and an **accuracy of approximately 70%** was achieved. The results were then evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, Recall, Kappa test, and F1-Score.
The proposed model considers a comprehensive set of geometric and functional parameters of the bridge structure to enhance prediction accuracy. In addition, many standardized approaches are adopted in the proposed model to improve its performance, including the evaluation of the most optimal set of model inputs, pre-processing and dividing the data, selecting internal parameters for control optimization, and model validation.
