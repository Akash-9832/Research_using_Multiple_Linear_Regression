# Research_using_Multiple_Linear_Regression
The focus of this research is to technically analyse the potential bridge sites based on the major prioritization indices and to determine risk factors related to particular locations leading to solutions for the permanent transportation problem in Nepal.
The model was evaluated using (50-50)%, (66-34)%, and (80-20)% train-test splits and 10-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of approximately 70% was achieved. The results were then evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, Recall, Kappa test, and F1-Score.
